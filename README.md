# CV Project

This project is created by me, based on requirement on TheOdinProject's PROJECT: CV APPLICATION (https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application).

This Project is built on ReactJS framework. The project is used to enhance my skill on using React's state and props, and dealing with form in React.
